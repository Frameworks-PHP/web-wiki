====== Register as a new wiki user ======
 
Welcome and thank you for desiring a PHP.net wiki account!

To create a new wiki account, please fill out all of the information below.
Make sure you supply a **valid e-mail address** - if you are not asked to enter a password here, a new one will be sent to that address.
The login name should be a valid [[doku>wiki:pagename|pagename]].

Once you register with this form and receive your wiki username you still _won't_ be able to edit the wiki until we manually authorize access.
This reduces wiki vandalism.  To get authorization you must send a quick introduction to the [[php-webmaster@lists.php.net|php-webmaster]] mailing list.
Mention your wiki username and say what you're planning to do.
This email lets us know you're a human (and not a robot) and what you'll be working on.
Approval may take several hours or days.
 
**Note**: If you find a minor problem with the wiki (like a typo or invalid grammar) then please email the [[php-webmaster@lists.php.net|php-webmaster]] mailing list with the URL, and suggested change.

**Note**: All information here is readable without registering. Write access is controlled however. All users with a svn.php.net account have full write access to the wiki, and may simply login with their SVN credentials.

**Note**: After submitting this registration form, your information (name and email) is sent to the publicly viewable [[http://news.php.net/php.webmaster|php-webmaster]] mailing list, along with your IP address, hostname, and user agent (browser info).
